# linuxTools

## Introductions
Goal of this repository is to capitalize small samples, easy to understand, and easy to use, in order to learn and use linux.

2 rules:
- A sample is autonomous, and must not rely on another sample, or too much complicated external dependencies. 
- A sample must provide a readme with an HowTo.

ℹ️ out-of-linux some other samples are available on [boly38/testAutonomousActions](https://github.com/boly38/testAutonomousActions)
